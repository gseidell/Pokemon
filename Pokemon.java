/*
 * This class contains the data for a pokemon in a more code friendly format.
 * As opposed to digging through a text file for everything.
 * Since the Pokemon class is more of an outline for each pokemon, rather than
 * the actualy pokemon you will use to battle (this will be a small text segment
 * that showdown reads), this class will have no methods. The game modes will be the
 * ones generating the sets and selecting the pokemon.
 * 
 * Ideas:
 * have a dialogue box asking for information about the pokemon such as typing
 * for the sake of later game modes. This box should then modify the original text
 * file to store the data.
